1. Working with asynchronous JavaScript:
   - Using async/await to load data from functions such as loadPlanCourses().
   - Handling asynchronous operations cleanly and avoiding nested callbacks.

2. DOM manipulation and dynamic UI rendering:
   - Creating and populating <select> dropdown options based on loaded plan data.
   - Adding event listeners (click event) to read selected values from the dropdown.
   - Dynamically updating the UI by clearing and injecting new HTML elements.

3. Data-driven rendering:
   - Extracting the selected planId and using it to filter data.
   - Rendering course lists based on the selected study plan.
   - Creating reusable helper functions such as createCourseItem() and coreCoursesEle().

4. Code organization and readability:
   - Separating responsibilities into small, clear functions (initPlanDropdown, sentPlanId, coreCoursesEle).
   - Using template strings and DOM methods for clean and structured output.
